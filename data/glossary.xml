Traditionally soft shoe move used primarily in ceili or beginner reels and comprised of 4 beats (and skip 2 3), a move done often in succession; two crossed steps taken by front and then back foot, then a 3rd on front foot during which the back foot skips up to bum and comes over to the front, then a 4th when the front foot hops
            2. A 2-beat skip, “and skip” where the front foot simply steps and then hops as the back foot lifts to come up and over (also could be described as “skip hop”)</description>
